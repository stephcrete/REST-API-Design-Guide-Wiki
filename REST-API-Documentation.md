> An API is only as good as its documentation is able to demonstrate.

The API documentation should...
* be easy to find and publically accessible.
* contain examples of complete requests/responses.
* include notifications about deprecation.

We have chosen to use the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification to describe our RESTful APIs.

We heavily recommend the contract first approach.
