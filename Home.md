# About
Welcome!

As explained in the [readme](README.md), this is the REST API Design Guide of the National Bank of Belgium.

# Terms
Rules and guidelines in this design guide have different levels. Some are optional while some others are mandatory. Also, there are recommendations against some approaches, as well as things that are simply forbidden.

Here's how each term should be understood:
MUST: it's mandatory (i.e., hard rule)
MUST NOT: it's forbidden (i.e., hard rule)
SHOULD: it's heavily recommended (i.e., soft rule)
SHOULD NOT: there may exist valid reasons not to respect this but the implications should be well understood
MAY/OPTIONAL: it's optional (i.e., advice)

Take a look at [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) for more details.
