In this section, we will explain how to implement the base CRUD operations.
Note that for bulk operations (e.g., bulk creation, etc), there is a dedicated section

# Sections
* [[CRUD Create Single item]]
* [[CRUD Retrieve Single item]]
* [[CRUD Retrieve Collection]]
* [[CRUD Update Single item]]
* [[CRUD Delete Single item]]
